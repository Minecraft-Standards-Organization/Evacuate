## Sign Request Protocol

Evacuate! only includes signs defined by the following standards:

- **ISO 7010** — International standard for graphical symbols on safety signs.
- **IMO A.1116(30)** — Maritime safety signs adopted by the International Maritime Organization.

When submitting a "Sign Request" issue, you must check the following box:

> **☑️ I understand that only ISO 7010 and IMO A.1116(30) signs will be added.**

This checkbox is **mandatory**. If it is **not checked**, your issue will be **automatically rejected**. If you **uncheck it after submission**, your issue will be **closed without review**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not request signs from other standards, fictional sources, or custom designs. Requests outside ISO 7010 and IMO A.1116(30) will not be considered.

> [!TIP]
> If you're unsure whether a sign qualifies, feel free to open a discussion before submitting an issue.

## Scope and Standards

Evacuate! is a standards-based mod. All content must adhere to the following principles:

- Signs must be **officially recognized** by ISO 7010 or IMO A.1116(30).
- Sign designs must be **accurate**, **unmodified**, and **faithful** to the source standard.
- No fictional, humorous, or stylized signs will be accepted.
- The mod does not include **custom signage**, **branding**, or **non-safety graphics**.

> [!TIP]
> If you have ideas for broader signage mods or custom content, consider creating a separate mod or fork. Evacuate! is strictly focused on standardized safety signs.
